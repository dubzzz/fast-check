> Property-based testing framework for JavaScript/TypeScript

## About

fast-check is a JavaScript/TypeScript library for property-based testing. It provides a comprehensive set of arbitraries (data generators) and utilities to help you write powerful and effective tests.

Property-based testing is a testing methodology where tests are written to verify properties (general rules) that should hold for all valid inputs, rather than testing specific examples. The framework automatically generates diverse test cases to find edge cases and potential bugs that traditional example-based tests might miss.

## Key Features

- **Extensive Arbitraries**: Built-in generators for primitives, objects, arrays, functions, and more
- **Shrinking**: Automatic reduction of failing test cases to minimal reproducible examples  
- **Async Support**: Full support for testing asynchronous code and promises
- **Framework Agnostic**: Works with any JavaScript testing framework (Jest, Mocha, Vitest, etc.)
- **TypeScript Ready**: First-class TypeScript support with comprehensive type definitions
- **Reproducible**: Deterministic test generation with seed support for debugging
