## Connectors

Create arbitraries based on other libraries.

For instance:

- Many data validators enable you to define and sometimes validate runtime values and obtain accurate TypeScript types. With these packages, they can also be utilized to derive arbitraries that can be seamlessly plugged within fast-check.
- Many fake data libraries come with powerful random and seeded generators, why don't you use them as arbitraries to ease migration path to full property-based testing?

### `@effect/schema` 🥇

![npm version](https://badge.fury.io/js/@effect%2Fschema.svg)
![monthly downloads](https://img.shields.io/npm/dm/@effect%2Fschema)
![last commit](https://img.shields.io/github/last-commit/effect-ts/effect)
![license](https://img.shields.io/npm/l/@effect%2Fschema.svg)
![third party package](https://img.shields.io/badge/-third%20party%20package-%2300abff.svg)

Generate random values that conform to a given `Schema`. It allows you to generate random test data that is guaranteed to be valid according to the `Schema`.

```ts
import * as Arbitrary from '@effect/schema/Arbitrary';
import * as S from '@effect/schema/Schema';
import * as fc from 'fast-check';

const Person = S.struct({
  name: S.string,
  age: S.string.pipe(S.compose(S.NumberFromString), S.int()),
});
const isPerson = S.is(Person);
const personArbitrary = Arbitrary.make(Person)(fc);

test('Only generating valid Person', () => {
  fc.assert(
    fc.property(personArbitrary, (person) => {
      expect(isPerson(person)).toBe(true);
    }),
  );
});

Ease your migration path to fast-check by easily converting the arbitraries you defined for [jsverify](http://jsverify.github.io/) into some for fast-check. While still maintained, we do not work actively on this project given the current state of jsverify: last released in 2018.

```js
import { jsc2fc } from 'jsverify-to-fast-check';
import * as jsc from 'jsverify';
import * as fc from 'fast-check';

// Here is an old arbitrary you prefer not to migrate for the moment
const jscArbitrary = jsc.bless({
  generator: jsc.generator.bless(() => {
    switch (jsc.random(0, 2)) {
      case 0:
        return 'foo';
      case 1:
        return 'bar';
      case 2:
        return 'quux';
    }
  }),
});

// It can easily converted into an arbitrary for fast-check using jsc2fc
const fcArbitrary = jsc2fc(jscArbitrary);
```

## Test runners

Although not designed for any particular test runners, some users prefer to have complete integration of fast-check within their preferred test runner. To meet these needs, we have compiled a list of packages that serve as the bridge between your favorite test runner and fast-check.

### `@fast-check/ava` ⭐

![npm version](https://badge.fury.io/js/@fast-check%2Fava.svg)
![monthly downloads](https://img.shields.io/npm/dm/@fast-check%2Fava)
![last commit](https://img.shields.io/github/last-commit/dubzzz/fast-check)
![license](https://img.shields.io/npm/l/@fast-check%2Fava.svg)
![official package](https://img.shields.io/badge/-official%20package-%23ffcb00.svg)

Bring support for property-based testing into [ava](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ava) with [@fast-check/ava](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@fast-check/ava).

```js
import { testProp, fc } from '@fast-check/ava';

testProp('should detect the substring', [fc.string(), fc.string(), fc.string()], (t, a, b, c) => {
  t.true((a + b + c).includes(b));
});
```

### `@fast-check/jest` ⭐

![npm version](https://badge.fury.io/js/@fast-check%2Fjest.svg)
![monthly downloads](https://img.shields.io/npm/dm/@fast-check%2Fjest)
![last commit](https://img.shields.io/github/last-commit/dubzzz/fast-check)
![license](https://img.shields.io/npm/l/@fast-check%2Fjest.svg)
![official package](https://img.shields.io/badge/-official%20package-%23ffcb00.svg)

Bring support for property-based testing into [jest](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ava).

In addition to offering enhanced versions of `test` and `it` functions, this package seamlessly synchronizes the timeouts of fast-check with those of jest. You no longer need to worry about setting separate timeouts for fast-check when you have already defined one in jest. This package handles the integration effortlessly, ensuring everything gets wired out-of-the-box.

```js
import { test, fc } from '@fast-check/jest';

test.prop([fc.string(), fc.string(), fc.string()])('should detect the substring', (a, b, c) => {
  return (a + b + c).includes(b);
});

test.prop({ a: fc.string(), b: fc.string(), c: fc.string() })('should detect the substring', ({ a, b, c }) => {
  return (a + b + c).includes(b);
});
```

import { test, fc } from '@fast-check/vitest';

test.prop([fc.string(), fc.string(), fc.string()])('should detect the substring', (a, b, c) => {
  return (a + b + c).includes(b);
});

test.prop({ a: fc.string(), b: fc.string(), c: fc.string() })('should detect the substring', ({ a, b, c }) => {
  return (a + b + c).includes(b);
});
```

## Superpowers

Although fast-check already includes an extensive set of capabilities, some features have been kept aside and have not been included within the core package. These additional packages offer some extra capabilities, such as more powerful checks or new runners.

### `@fast-check/poisoning` ⭐

![npm version](https://badge.fury.io/js/@fast-check%2Fpoisoning.svg)
![monthly downloads](https://img.shields.io/npm/dm/@fast-check%2Fpoisoning)
![last commit](https://img.shields.io/github/last-commit/dubzzz/fast-check)
![license](https://img.shields.io/npm/l/@fast-check%2Fpoisoning.svg)
![official package](https://img.shields.io/badge/-official%20package-%23ffcb00.svg)

Prototype poisoning is a commonly exploited vulnerability that can lead to various security weaknesses. Historical vulnerabilities in the ecosystem have been linked to prototype poisoning but detecting and addressing them is not always straightforward. The [@fast-check/poisoning](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@fast-check/poisoning) package has been specifically designed to address this need.

By utilizing this package in conjunction with fast-check, you can effectively safeguard against inadvertently modifying global prototypes when your code interacts with specially crafted inputs. Using both packages together unlocks their full potential and pushes your testing capabilities a step forward.

```js
import fc from 'fast-check';
import { assertNoPoisoning, restoreGlobals } from '@fast-check/poisoning';

const ignoredRootRegex = /^(__coverage__|console)$/;
function poisoningAfterEach() {
  try {
    assertNoPoisoning({ ignoredRootRegex });
  } catch (err) {
    restoreGlobals({ ignoredRootRegex });
    throw err;
  }
}
fc.configureGlobal({ afterEach: poisoningAfterEach });

test('should detect the substring', () => {
  fc.assert(
    fc.property(fc.string(), fc.string(), fc.string(), (a, b, c) => {
      expect(isSubstring(a + b + c, b)).toBe(true);
    }),
  );
});
```

### `@fast-check/worker` ⭐

![npm version](https://badge.fury.io/js/@fast-check%2Fworker.svg)
![monthly downloads](https://img.shields.io/npm/dm/@fast-check%2Fworker)
![last commit](https://img.shields.io/github/last-commit/dubzzz/fast-check)
![license](https://img.shields.io/npm/l/@fast-check%2Fworker.svg)
![official package](https://img.shields.io/badge/-official%20package-%23ffcb00.svg)

By default fast-check does not change where the code runs: everything run within the original process. [@fast-check/worker](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@fast-check/worker) package allows you to delegate the execution of predicates to dedicated worker threads. It brings several advantages, including the ability to stop synchronously running predicates.

```js
import { test, expect } from '@jest/globals';
import fc from 'fast-check';
import { isMainThread } from 'node:worker_threads';
import { assert, propertyFor } from '@fast-check/worker';

const property = propertyFor(new URL(import.meta.url)); // or propertyFor(pathToFileURL(__filename)) in commonjs
const isSubstringProperty = property(fc.string(), fc.string(), fc.string(), (a, b, c) => {
  expect(isSubstring(a + b + c, b)).toBe(true);
});

if (isMainThread) {
  test('should detect the substring', async () => {
    await assert(isSubstringProperty, { timeout: 1000 });
  });
}
```

:::info Integration with Jest runner
`@fast-check/worker` is directly integrating with `@fast-check/jest`. Checkout the [official documentation of `@fast-check/jest`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@fast-check/jest) for more details.
