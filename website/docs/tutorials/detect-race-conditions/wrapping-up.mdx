# Wrapping up

We could have went for:

```js
const queued = queue(s.scheduleFunction(call));
queued(1).then((v) => seenAnswers.push(v));
queued(2).then((v) => seenAnswers.push(v));
await s.waitAll();
```

But it makes an implicit assumption: at `s.waitAll` queries would been have launched. As we know all the fired queries or don't care for missing ones (others) it should be a better proxy.
