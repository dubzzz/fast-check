# Others

Several other arbitraries.

## falsy

Falsy values.

Generate falsy values ie. one of: `false`, `null`, `undefined`, `0`, `''`, `Number.NaN` or `0n`.

**Signatures:**

- `fc.falsy()`

**Usages:**

```js
fc.falsy();
// Examples of generated values: null, 0, false, undefined, ""…

fc.falsy({ withBigInt: true });
// Examples of generated values: null, Number.NaN, false, undefined, 0n…
```

Resources: [API reference](https://fast-check.dev/api-reference/functions/falsy.html).  
Available since 1.26.0.

## context

Generate an [instance of `ContextValue`](https://fast-check.dev/api-reference/interfaces/ContextValue.html) for each predicate run.

`ContextValue` can be used to log stuff within the run itself. In case of failure, the logs will be attached in the counterexample and visible in the stack trace.

**Signatures:**

- `fc.context()`

**Usages:**

```js
fc.context();
// The produced value - let's call it ctx - can be used as a logger that will be specific to this run (and only this run).
// It can be called as follow: ctx.log('My log')
```

Resources: [API reference](https://fast-check.dev/api-reference/functions/context.html).  
Available since 1.8.0.

## commands

Iterables of commands.

Model based testing approach extends the power of property based testing to state machines.
It relies on commands or operations that a user can run on the system. Those commands define:

- pre-condition — confirm whether or not the command can be executed given the current context
- execution — update a simplified context or _model_ while updating and checking the _real_ system

**Signatures:**

- `fc.commands(commandArbs)`
- `fc.commands(commandArbs, {disableReplayLog?, maxCommands?, size?, replayPath?})`

**with:**

- `commandArbs` — _array of arbitraries responsible to generate commands_
- `disableReplayLog?` — default: `false` — _disable the display of details regarding the replay for commands_
- `maxCommands?` — default: `0x7fffffff` [more](/docs/configuration/larger-entries-by-default/#size-explained) — _maximal number of commands to generate (included)_
- `size?` — default: `undefined` [more](/docs/configuration/larger-entries-by-default/#size-explained) — _how large should the generated values be?_
- `replayPath?` — _only used when replaying commands_

**Usages:**

```js
type Model = { /* stuff */ };
type Real  = { /* stuff */ };

class CommandA extends Command { /* stuff */ };
class CommandB extends Command { /* stuff */ };
// other commands

const CommandsArbitrary = fc.commands([
  fc.constant(new CommandA()),        // no custom parameters
  fc.nat().map(s => new CommandB(s)), // with custom parameter
  // other commands
]);

fc.assert(
  fc.property(
    CommandsArbitrary,
    cmds => {
      const s = () => ({ // initial state builder
          model: /* new model */,
          real:  /* new system instance */
      });
      fc.modelRun(s, cmds);
    }
  )
);
```

## gen

This arbitrary has been designed to simplify the usage of Property Based Testing.
It helps to easily leverage Property Based Testing capabilities into tests based on fake-data.

:::warning No replay capabilities
When replaying failures on properties including a `fc.gen()`, you need to drop the path part. More precisely, you may keep the very first part but have to drop anything after the first ":".
:::

:::warning Must be called in a deterministic order
Calls to the produced instance must be done in a determistic order.
:::

**Signatures:**

- `fc.gen()`

**Usages:**

```js
fc.gen();
// The produced value is a function able to generate random values from arbitraries within the tests themselves.
//
// It takes from 1 to N parameters:
// - the first parameter is a function able to return an arbitrary — ⚠️ this function must be a static function and not be recreated from one run to another
// - and its parameters as second, third...
//
// It can be called as follow:
// - g(fc.nat) — building a random value during the predicate using the arbitrary fc.nat()
// - g(fc.nat, {max: 10}) — same but using fc.nat({max: 10})
//
// ⚠️ But DO NOT USE: g(() => fc.nat({max: 10})).
// In the case right above, neither the builder of arbitrary nor the arbitrary itself are stable references. It would make shrinking impossible.
// If you do need to create a dedicated builder, define it outside of `fc.assert` and use it in your predicate as `g(myBuilder, ...parametersForMyBuilder)`.
```

Available since 3.8.0.

## scheduler

Scheduler for asynchronous tasks.

**Signatures:**

- `fc.scheduler()`
- `fc.scheduler({ act? })`

**with:**

- `act` — _ensure that all scheduled tasks will be executed in the right context_

Resources: [API reference](https://fast-check.dev/api-reference/functions/scheduler-1.html).  
Available since 1.20.0.
