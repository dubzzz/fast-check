# AI-Powered Testing 🧙

Enhance your testing workflow with AI assistance while maintaining high-quality test coverage using fast-check.

## Configure AI for JavaScript Testing Excellence

fast-check provides an expert-level JavaScript testing skill that teaches AI assistants best practices for writing high-quality tests.

Install the skill to your AI assistant:

```bash
npx skills add dubzzz/fast-check --skill javascript-testing-expert
```

## What the Skill Provides

The `javascript-testing-expert` skill focuses on testing functions and components (not black-box e2e testing) with four main objectives:

1. **Uncover hard-to-detect bugs** through property-based testing
2. **Document how to use the code** with clear example-based tests
3. **Avoid regressions** with targeted assertions
4. **Challenge the code** with edge cases and random inputs

The skill ensures your AI-generated tests:

- Find real bugs through property-based testing and edge case exploration
- Serve as documentation with clear, readable test cases
- Prevent regressions with focused assertions
- Avoid common pitfalls like flaky tests, over-mocking, and brittle snapshots
- Follow the AAA (Arrange-Act-Assert) pattern
- Control non-determinism by stubbing dates, randomness, and external dependencies
