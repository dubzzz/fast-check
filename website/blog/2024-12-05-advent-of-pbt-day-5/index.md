Christmas is at risk! In their rush to meet tight deadlines, Santaâ€™s elves accidentally introduced bugs into critical algorithms. If these issues arenâ€™t discovered in time, Christmas could be delayed for everyone worldwide!

Your mission is to troubleshoot these black-box algorithms using the power of fast-check.

The clock is ticking. Santa just pinged you with your next challenge: heâ€™s worried about the security of his high-traffic website. The elves have created a system to validate security keys, but Santa fears it might be flawed. Can you test their implementation and ensure itâ€™s rock solid? ðŸŽ„ðŸ”§

## SSL/TLS security checks

Santa has been diving deep into the world of computer science. Itâ€™s already Day 5, and heâ€™s spent most of his time diving into books about web security. With his website handling massive traffic and being a prime target for hackers, Santa is determined to ensure its securityâ€”and that of its usersâ€”remains uncompromised.

To that end, he asked his elves to build an algorithm to validate security keys. According to Santaâ€™s definition, a valid key is a number that can be expressed as the product of exactly two distinct prime numbers. For instance:

- `6 = 2 Ã— 3` is valid.
- `30 = 2 Ã— 3 x 5` is not valid (it has more than two primes).
- `5` is also not valid (itâ€™s a prime, but not a product of two primes).

## Hands on

The elves delivered the algorithm! But as always, Santa wants you to double-check their work. Before you dive into the playground to test their implementation, here are some key details Santa wants you to remember: The algorithm only supports keys within the range of 2 to 2,147,483,647 (inclusive).

Your task, using the property-based testing features of fast-check, is to find a key that breaks the elvesâ€™ implementation.

You are Santaâ€™s last hope to safeguard the security of his website â€” donâ€™t let him down! ðŸŽ„ðŸ”§
