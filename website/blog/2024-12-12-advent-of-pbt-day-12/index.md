Christmas is at risk! In their rush to meet tight deadlines, Santaâ€™s elves accidentally introduced bugs into critical algorithms. If these issues arenâ€™t discovered in time, Christmas could be delayed for everyone worldwide!

Your mission is to troubleshoot these black-box algorithms using the power of fast-check.

The clock is ticking. Santa just pinged you with your next challenge: the elvesâ€™ newly released routing system for the sleigh might have issues. Can you uncover potential flaws and ensure Santa reaches his destination in record time? ðŸŽ„âœ¨

## Fast Travel Planner

_"Tomorrow is the big day!"_ Santa announces with excitement.

_"What big day?"_ you wonder, slightly puzzled.

It turns out Santa has been eagerly awaiting React Day Berlin! A fan of cutting-edge dev techniques and knowledge sharing, heâ€™s been counting down to this conference since last year. Itâ€™s his ideal last-minute break to explore the latest React trends before the Christmas rush.

This morning, Santaâ€™s elves proudly unveiled the latest iteration of the sleighâ€™s routing system â€” a sophisticated algorithm designed to calculate the fastest route for delivering gifts to children worldwide. But Santa has another plan: to test the system before Christmas during his trip to the conference.

The algorithm operates on a list of all known routes in Santaâ€™s network, with each route defined as a directed edge::

- `from`: The starting point of the route, represented as a string consisting of a single lowercase letter (`a` to `z`).
- `to`: The destination of the route, represented as a string consisting of a single lowercase letter (`a` to `z`).
- `distance`: The time it takes to travel, expressed as a strictly positive integer being less than `2**31-1`.

Given a starting location and a desired destination, the algorithm either:

- Returns the routes to take for the fastest journey, or
- Indicates that no path exists to the destination.

## Hands on

Thereâ€™s just one problem. While the algorithm was released this morning, itâ€™s still in its testing phase. Santa, however, insists on using it now and absolutely cannot be late for React Day Berlin.

Thatâ€™s where you come in!

Your mission: rigorously test the sleighâ€™s routing algorithm to ensure it finds the most efficient path from start to destination.

Christmas â€” and Santaâ€™s conference dreams â€” are counting on you! Donâ€™t let him down. ðŸŽ„âœ¨
