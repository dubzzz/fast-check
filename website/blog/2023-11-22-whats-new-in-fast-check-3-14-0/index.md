This release changes the way we import type-only files internally in fast-check. While it should not have any visible impact on our clients we preferred to make it a minor.

## Importing types

Everything started with barrel files...

When I read the article [Speeding up the JavaScript ecosystem - The barrel file debacle](https://marvinh.dev/blog/speeding-up-javascript-ecosystem-part-7/), I asked myself: "What if I can make fast-check faster just by bundling it differently". And so I started to probe the (runtime) cost of importing fast-check differently.

The (still opened) issue [fast-check#4324](https://github.com/dubzzz/fast-check/issues/4324) has been created to start the investigation. I probed several setups against [Jest](https://jestjs.io/):

```js title="no-import.test.cjs"
test('empty test in spec file without any import', () => {});
// spec file execution took ~0.44s (4 runs: 0.436, 0.44, 0.441, 0.443)
```

```js title="current-import.test.cjs"
const fc = require('fast-check');
test('empty test in spec file with recommended import for fast-check', () => {
  fc; // no-op, just doing so to avoid bundlers from ignoring the import
});
// spec file execution took ~0.67s (4 runs: 0.677, 0.656, 0.7, 0.656)
```

```js title="future-import.test.cjs"
const { assert } = require('fast-check/assert');
test('empty test in spec file with recommended import for fast-check', () => {
  assert; // no-op, just doing so to avoid bundlers from ignoring the import
});
// spec file execution took ~0.47s (4 runs: 0.473, 0.475, 0.474, 0.473)
```

While these measurements need to be confirmed on more runs, they seem to highlight that the way to import can have an impact on the final users. That's said, we paused the ticket at that point. Indeed supporting `require` or `import` of a sub-path would require exports map in our package.json and would imply dropping support for old versions of Node and possibly requesting TypeScript's users to change a bit their configurations.

We actually not stopped totally! We went for the feasible part: we changed each internal import importing types to the `import type` syntax. It provided us a significant boost in the execution of our own tests. From a client point-of-view, it might not have that much impact but given the fact it played on bundling tricks, we preferred to make it a minor version.
