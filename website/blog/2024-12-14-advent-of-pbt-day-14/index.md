Christmas is at risk! In their rush to meet tight deadlines, Santaâ€™s elves accidentally introduced bugs into critical algorithms. If these issues arenâ€™t discovered in time, Christmas could be delayed for everyone worldwide!

Your mission is to troubleshoot these black-box algorithms using the power of fast-check.

The clock is ticking! Santa just reached out with a new challenge: the elvesâ€™ compression algorithm for children's letters might have some flaws. Can you identify edge cases that break the system and ensure everything works smoothly? ðŸŽ„ðŸ”§

## Memory efficient storage

With childrenâ€™s letters piling up year after year, Santa asked his elves to design a basic compression algorithm to save storage space. The goal? Efficiently reduce the size of repetitive patterns in text while keeping the content readable and reversible.

The elves devised a straightforward yet effective approach and shared the core concept with Santa:

- Identify consecutive characters
- Replace with a count-character pair

For example: `"hello"` becomes `"1h1e2l1o"`. While not particularly efficient for this example, the elves emphasize that this algorithm is just one piece of a larger, more advanced compression system they plan to implement.

## Hands on

The elves completed the task promptly and even provided a matching reverse function. However, Santa has concerns. He suspects there might be edge cases leading the system to fail. Your mission: find a text that causes issues for the system and prove that thereâ€™s a bug.

Christmas depends on your testing skills. Donâ€™t let Santa down! ðŸŽ…ðŸ”§
