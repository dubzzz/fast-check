## ULID

The arbitrary `ulid` has been introduced to ease the creation of ULID ids.

```js
fc.ulid();
// Examples of generated values:
// • "7AVDFZJAXCM0F25E3SZZZZZZYZ"
// • "7ZZZZZZZYP5XN60H51ZZZZZZZP"
// • "2VXXEMQ2HWRSNWMP9PZZZZZZZA"
// • "15RQ23H1M8YB80EVPD2EG8W7K1"
// • "6QV4RKC7C8ZZZZZZZFSF7PWQF5"
// • …
```

## Other changes

We have recently enhanced our README by adding additional badges that emphasize the overall security and quality of open-source projects:
