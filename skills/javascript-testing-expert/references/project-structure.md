# Project Structure

> **⚠️ Scope:** Where to put test files in the project?

**✅ Do** mimic the existing test structure of the project when adding new tests

**✅ Do** use one test file per code file

**👍 Prefer** using `.spec.ts` extension (e.g., `fileName.ts` → `fileName.spec.ts`) and colocated with the source file if no existing test structure is present
