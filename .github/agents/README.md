**Expertise includes:**
- Writing effective property-based tests
- Creating custom arbitraries for domain-specific data
- Model-based testing for stateful systems
- Identifying testable properties and invariants
- Advanced techniques (shrinking, preconditions, race condition detection)
- Common patterns from Advent of Property-Based Testing

**When to use this agent:**
- Writing new property-based tests
- Creating custom arbitraries
- Implementing model-based tests for stateful systems
- Learning about property-based testing patterns
- Optimizing existing property tests
- Understanding fast-check API and best practices

**Example use cases:**
- "Help me write property-based tests for a sorting function"
- "Create a custom arbitrary for generating valid email addresses"
- "Set up model-based testing for a music player with play/pause/next commands"
- "What properties should I test for a binary search tree implementation?"
- "How do I test for race conditions in an async function?"

## How to Use Custom Agents

Custom agents are specialized AI assistants that can be invoked when you need expert help in specific domains. To use an agent:

1. Mention or request help related to the agent's domain
2. The agent will provide expert guidance tailored to that domain
3. Follow the agent's recommendations and examples

These agents have been trained with domain-specific knowledge and best practices to provide high-quality assistance in their respective areas.
