# [:house:](../README.md) Arbitraries

Arbitraries are responsible for the random - *but deterministic* - generation and shrink of datatypes. [They can be combined together](./AdvancedArbitraries.md) to build more complex datatypes.

This documentation lists all the built-in arbitraries provided by fast-check.

You can refer to the [generated API docs](https://dubzzz.github.io/fast-check/#/2-API/fast-check) for more details.

## String (:string)

Single character only:

- `fc.hexa()` one character in `0123456789abcdef` (lower case)
- `fc.base64()` one character in `A-Z`, `a-z`, `0-9`, `+` or `/`
- `fc.char()` between 0x20 (included) and 0x7e (included) , corresponding to printable characters (see https://www.ascii-code.com/)
- `fc.ascii()` between 0x00 (included) and 0x7f (included)
- `fc.unicode()` between 0x0000 (included) and 0xffff (included) but excluding surrogate pairs (between 0xd800 and 0xdfff). Generate any character of UCS-2 which is a subset of UTF-16 (restricted to BMP plan)
- `fc.char16bits()` between 0x0000 (included) and 0xffff (included). Generate any 16 bits character. Be aware the values within 0xd800 and 0xdfff which constitutes the surrogate pair characters are also generated meaning that some generated characters might appear invalid regarding UCS-2 and UTF-16 encoding
- `fc.fullUnicode()` between 0x0000 (included) and 0x10ffff (included) but excluding surrogate pairs (between 0xd800 and 0xdfff). Its length can be greater than one as it potentially contains multiple UTF-16 characters for a single glyph

Multiple characters:

- `fc.hexaString()`, `fc.hexaString(maxLength: number)` or `fc.hexaString(minLength: number, maxLength: number)` string based on characters generated by `fc.hexa()`
- `fc.base64String()`, `fc.base64String(maxLength: number)` or `fc.base64String(minLength: number, maxLength: number)` string based on characters generated by `fc.base64()`. Provide valid base64 strings: length always multiple of 4 padded with '=' characters. When using `minLength` and `maxLength` make sure that they are compatible together. For instance: asking for `minLength=2` and `maxLength=4` is impossible for base64 strings as produced by the framework
- `fc.string()`, `fc.string(maxLength: number)` or `fc.string(minLength: number, maxLength: number)` string based on characters generated by `fc.char()`
- `fc.asciiString()`, `fc.asciiString(maxLength: number)` or `fc.asciiString(minLength: number, maxLength: number)` string based on characters generated by `fc.ascii()`
- `fc.unicodeString()`, `fc.unicodeString(maxLength: number)` or `fc.unicodeString(minLength: number, maxLength: number)` string based on characters generated by `fc.unicode()`
- `fc.string16bits()`, `fc.string16bits(maxLength: number)` or `fc.string16bits(minLength: number, maxLength: number)` string based on characters generated by `fc.char16bits()`. Be aware that the generated string might appear invalid regarding the unicode standard as it might contain incomplete pairs of surrogate
- `fc.fullUnicodeString()`, `fc.fullUnicodeString(maxLength: number)` or `fc.fullUnicodeString(minLength: number, maxLength: number)` string based on characters generated by `fc.fullUnicode()`. Be aware that the length is considered in terms of the number of glyphs in the string and not the number of UTF-16 characters
- `fc.stringOf(charArb: Arbitrary<string>)`, `fc.stringOf(charArb: Arbitrary<string>, maxLength: number)` or `fc.stringOf(charArb: Arbitrary<string>, minLength: number, maxLength: number)` string based on characters generated by `charArb`. `minLength` and  `maxLength` define bounds of the number of elements generated using `charArb` that can be found in the final string

More specific strings:

- `fc.json()` or `fc.json(maxDepth: number)` json strings having keys generated using `fc.string()`. String values are also produced by `fc.string()`
- `fc.unicodeJson()` or `fc.unicodeJson(maxDepth: number)` json strings having keys generated using `fc.unicodeString()`. String values are also produced by `fc.unicodeString()`
- `fc.lorem()`, `fc.lorem(maxWordsCount: number)` or `fc.lorem(maxWordsCount: number, sentencesMode: boolean)` lorem ipsum strings. Generator can be configured by giving it a maximum number of characters by using `maxWordsCount` or switching the mode to sentences by setting `sentencesMode` to `true` in which case `maxWordsCount` is used to cap the number of sentences allowed
- `fc.ipV4()` IP v4 strings
- `fc.ipV4Extended()` IP v4 strings including all the formats supported by WhatWG standard (for instance: 0x6f.9)
- `fc.ipV6()` IP v6 strings
- `fc.uuid()` UUID strings having only digits in 0-9a-f (only versions in v1 to v5)
- `fc.uuidV(versionNumber: 1|2|3|4|5)` UUID strings for a specific UUID version only digits in 0-9a-f
- `fc.domain()` Domain name with extension following RFC 1034, RFC 1123 and WHATWG URL Standard
- `fc.webAuthority()` Web authority following RFC 3986
- `fc.webFragments()` Fragments to build an URI. Fragment is the optional part right after the # in an URI
- `fc.webQueryParameters()` Query parameters to build an URI. Fragment is the optional part right after the ? in an URI
- `fc.webSegment()` Web URL path segment
- `fc.webUrl()` Web URL following the specs specified by RFC 3986 and WHATWG URL Standard
- `fc.emailAddress()` Email address following RFC 1123 and RFC 5322
- `fc.mixedCase(stringArb: Arbitrary<string>)` or `fc.mixedCase(stringArb: Arbitrary<string>, constraints: MixedCaseConstraints)` Randomly switch the case of characters generated by `stringArb`

## Date (:Date)

- `fc.date()` or `fc.date({min?: Date, max?: Date})` any date between new Date(-8640000000000000) or min (included) to new Date(8640000000000000) or max (included)

## Combinors of arbitraries (:T)

- `fc.constant<T>(value: T): Arbitrary<T>` constant arbitrary only able to produce `value: T`
- `fc.constantFrom<T>(...values: T[]): Arbitrary<T>` randomly chooses among the values provided. It considers the first value as the default value so that in case of failure it will shrink to it. It expects a minimum of one value and throws whether it receives no value as parameters. It can easily be used on arrays with `fc.constantFrom(...myArray)` (or `fc.constantFrom.apply(null, myArray)` for older versions of TypeScript/JavaScript)
- `fc.clonedConstant<T>(value: T): Arbitrary<T>` constant arbitrary only able to produce `value: T`. If it exists, it called its `[fc.cloneMethod]` at each call to generate
- `fc.mapToConstant<T>(...entries: { num: number; build: (idInGroup: number) => T }[]): Arbitrary<T>` generates non-contiguous ranges of values by mapping integer values to constant
- `fc.oneof<T>(...arbs: Arbitrary<T>[]): Arbitrary<T>` randomly chooses an arbitrary at each new generation. Should be provided with at least one arbitrary. All arbitraries are equally probable and shrink is still working for the selected arbitrary. `fc.oneof` is able to shrink inside the failing arbitrary but not accross arbitraries (contrary to `fc.constantFrom` when dealing with constant arbitraries)
- `fc.option<T>(arb: Arbitrary<T>): Arbitrary<T | null>` or `fc.option<T>(arb: Arbitrary<T>, freq: number): Arbitrary<T | null>` arbitrary able to nullify its generated value. When provided a custom `freq` value it changes the frequency of `null` values so that they occur one time over `freq` tries (eg.: `freq=5` means that 20% of generated values will be `null` and 80% would be produced through `arb`). By default: `freq=5`
- `fc.subarray<T>(originalArray: T[]): Arbitrary<T[]>`, or `fc.subarray<T>(originalArray: T[], minLength: number, maxLength: number): Arbitrary<T[]>` subarray of `originalArray`. Values inside the subarray are ordered the same way they are in `originalArray`. By setting the parameters `minLength` and/or `maxLength`, the user can change the minimal (resp. maximal) size allowed for the generated subarray. By default: `minLength=0` and `maxLength=originalArray.length`
- `fc.shuffledSubarray<T>(originalArray: T[]): Arbitrary<T[]>`, or `fc.shuffledSubarray<T>(originalArray: T[], minLength: number, maxLength: number): Arbitrary<T[]>` subarray of `originalArray`. Values within the subarray are ordered randomly. By setting the parameters `minLength` and/or `maxLength`, the user can change the minimal (resp. maximal) size allowed for the generated subarray. By default: `minLength=0` and `maxLength=originalArray.length`
- `fc.array<T>(arb: Arbitrary<T>): Arbitrary<T[]>`, `fc.array<T>(arb: Arbitrary<T>, maxLength: number): Arbitrary<T[]>` or `fc.array<T>(arb: Arbitrary<T>, minLength: number, maxLength: number): Arbitrary<T[]>` array of random length containing values generated by `arb`. By setting the parameters `minLength` and/or `maxLength`, the user can change the minimal (resp. maximal) size allowed for the generated array. By default: `minLength=0` and `maxLength=10`
- `fc.set<T>(arb: Arbitrary<T>): Arbitrary<T[]>`, `fc.set<T>(arb: Arbitrary<T>, maxLength: number): Arbitrary<T[]>` or `fc.set<T>(arb: Arbitrary<T>, minLength: number, maxLength: number): Arbitrary<T[]>` set of random length containing unique values generated by `arb`. All the values in the set are unique given the default `comparator = (a: T, b: T) => a === b` which can be overriden by giving another comparator function as the last argument on previous signatures
- `fc.tuple<T1,T2,...>(arb1: Arbitrary<T1>, arb2: Arbitrary<T2>, ...): Arbitrary<[T1,T2,...]>` tuple generated by aggregating the values of `arbX` like `generate: () => [arb1.generate(), arb2.generate(), ...]`. This arbitrary perfectly handle shrinks and is able to shink on all the generators
- `fc.dictionary<T>(keyArb: Arbitrary<string>, valueArb: Arbitrary<T>): Arbitrary<{[Key:string]:T}>` dictionary containing keys generated using `keyArb` and values gneerated by `valueArb`
- `fc.record<T>(recordModel: {[Key:string]: Arbitrary<T>}): Arbitrary<{[Key:string]: T}>` or `fc.record<T>(recordModel: {[Key:string]: Arbitrary<T>}, constraints: RecordConstraints): Arbitrary<{[Key:string]: T}>` record using the incoming arbitraries to generate its values. It comes very useful when dealing with settings. It takes an optional parameter of type `RecordConstraints` to configure some of its properties. The setting `withDeletedKeys=true` instructs the record generator that it can omit some keys
- `fc.infiniteStream<T>(arb: Arbitrary<T>): Arbitrary<Stream<T>>` infinite `Stream` of values generated by `arb`. The `Stream` structure provided by fast-check implements `IterableIterator<T>` and comes with useful helpers to manipulate it
- `fc.dedup<T>(arb: Arbitrary<T>, numValues: number)` tuple containing `numValues` instances of the same value produced by `arb` - values are independent from each others

## Objects (:any)

The framework is able to generate totally random objects in order to adapt to programs that do not requires any specific data structure. All those custom types can be parametrized using `ObjectConstraints.Settings`.

```typescript
export module ObjectConstraints {
    export interface Settings {
        maxDepth?: number;         // maximal depth allowed for this object
        maxKeys?: number;          // maximal number of keys (and values)
        key?: Arbitrary<string>;   // arbitrary for key
        values?: Arbitrary<any>[]; // arbitrary responsible for base value
        withBoxedValues?: boolean; // adapt all entries within `values` to generate boxed version of the value too
        withMap?: boolean;         // also generate Map
        withSet?: boolean;         // also generate Set
        withObjectString?: boolean;// also generate string representations of object instances
    };
};
```

Default for `key` is: `fc.string()`.

Default for `values` are: `fc.boolean()`, `fc.integer()`, `fc.double()`, `fc.string()` and constants among `null`, `undefined`, `Number.NaN`, `+0`, `-0`, `Number.EPSILON`, `Number.MIN_VALUE`, `Number.MAX_VALUE` , `Number.MIN_SAFE_INTEGER`, `Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER`, `Number.POSITIVE_INFINITY` or `Number.NEGATIVE_INFINITY`.

- `fc.anything()` or `fc.anything(settings: ObjectConstraints.Settings)` generate a possible values coming from Settings and all objects or arrays derived from those same settings
- `fc.object()` or `fc.object(settings: ObjectConstraints.Settings)` generate an object
- `fc.jsonObject()` or `fc.jsonObject(maxDepth: number)` generate an object that is eligible to be stringified and parsed back to itself (object compatible with json stringify)
- `fc.unicodeJsonObject()` or `fc.unicodeJsonObject(maxDepth: number)` generate an object with potentially unicode characters that is eligible to be stringified and parsed back to itself (object compatible with json stringify)

## Recursive structures

- `fc.letrec(builder: (tie) => { [arbitraryName: string]: Arbitrary<T> })` produce arbitraries as specified by builder function. The `tie` function given to builder should be used as a placeholder to handle the recursion. It takes as input the name of the arbitrary to use in the recursion

```typescript
const { tree } = fc.letrec(tie => ({
  // tree is 1 / 3 of node, 2 / 3 of leaf
  // Warning: as there is no control over the depth of the data-structures generated
  //   by letrec, high probability of node can lead to very deep trees
  //   thus we limit the probability of a node to p = 1 / 3 in this example
  // with p = 0.50 the probability to have a tree of depth above 10 is 13.9 %
  // with p = 0.33 the probability to have a tree of depth above 10 is  0.6 %
  tree: fc.oneof(tie('node'), tie('leaf'), tie('leaf')),
  node: fc.tuple(tie('tree'), tie('tree')),
  leaf: fc.nat()
}));
tree() // Is a tree arbitrary (as fc.nat() is an integer arbitrary)
```

- `fc.memo<T>(builder: (n: number) => Arbitrary<T>): ((n?: number) => Arbitrary<T>)` produce arbitraries as specified by builder function. Contrary to `fc.letrec`, `fc.memo` can control the maximal depth of your recursive structure by relying on the `n` parameter given as input of the `builder` function

```typescript
const tree: fc.Memo<Tree> = fc.memo(n => fc.oneof(node(n), leaf()));
const node: fc.Memo<Tree> = fc.memo(n => {
  if (n <= 1) return fc.record({ left: leaf(), right: leaf() });
  return fc.record({ left: tree(), right: tree() }); // tree() is equivalent to tree(n-1)
});
const leaf = fc.nat;
tree() // Is a tree arbitrary (as fc.nat() is an integer arbitrary)
       // with maximal depth of 10 (equivalent to tree(10))
```

## Functions

- `compareBooleanFunc()` generate a comparison function taking two parameters `a` and `b` and producing a boolean value. `true` means that `a < b`, `false` that `a = b` or `a > b`
- `compareFunc()` generate a comparison function taking two parameters `a` and `b` and producing an integer value. Output is zero when `a` and `b` are considered to be equivalent. Output is strictly inferior to zero means that `a` should be considered strictly inferior to `b` (similar for strictly superior to zero)
- `func(arb: Arbitrary<TOut>)` generate a function of type `(...args: TArgs) => TOut` outputing values generated using `arb`

## Extended tools

- `context()` generate a `Context` instance for each predicate run. `Context` can be used to log stuff within the run itself. In case of failure, the logs will be attached in the counterexample and visible in the stack trace

## Model based testing

Model based testing approach extends the power of property based testing to state machines - *eg.: UI, data-structures*.

See section [Model based testing or UI test](./Tips.md#model-based-testing-or-ui-test) in Tips for an in depth explanation.

### Commands

The approach relies on commands. Commands can be seen as operations a user can run on the system. Those commands have:
- pre-condition - *implemented by `check`* - confirming whether or not the command can be executed given the current context
- execution - *implemented by `run`* - responsible to update a simplified context while updating and checking the real system

Commands can either be synchronous - `fc.Command<Model, Real>` - or asynchronous - `fc.AsyncCommand<Model, Real>` or  `fc.AsyncCommand<Model, Real, true>`.

```typescript
// Real : system under test
// Model: simplified state for the system
export interface Command<Model extends object, Real> {
  // Check if the model is in the right state to apply the command
  // WARNING: does not change the model
  check(m: Readonly<Model>): boolean;

  // Execute on r and perform the checks - Throw in case of invalid state
  // Update the model - m - accordingly
  run(m: Model, r: Real): void;

  // Name of the command
  toString(): string;
}

export interface AsyncCommand<Model extends object, Real> {
  check(m: Readonly<Model>): boolean;
  run(m: Model, r: Real): Promise<void>;
  toString(): string;
}

export interface AsyncCommand<Model extends object, Real, true> {
  check(m: Readonly<Model>): Promise<boolean>;
  run(m: Model, r: Real): Promise<void>;
  toString(): string;
}
```

### Arbitrary

While `fc.array` or any other array arbitrary could be used to generate such data, it is highly recommended to rely on `fc.commands` to generate arrays of commands. Its shrinker would be more adapted for such cases.

Possible signatures:
- `fc.commands<Model, Real>(commandArbs: Arbitrary<Command<Model, Real>>[], maxCommands?: number)` arrays of `Command` that can be ingested by `fc.modelRun`
- `fc.commands<Model, Real>(commandArbs: Arbitrary<Command<Model, Real>>[], settings: CommandsSettings)` arrays of `Command` that can be ingested by `fc.modelRun`
- `fc.commands<Model, Real>(commandArbs: Arbitrary<AsyncCommand<Model, Real>>[], maxCommands?: number)` arrays of `AsyncCommand` that can be ingested by `fc.asyncModelRun`
- `fc.commands<Model, Real>(commandArbs: Arbitrary<AsyncCommand<Model, Real>>[], settings: CommandsSettings)` arrays of `AsyncCommand` that can be ingested by `fc.asyncModelRun`

Possible settings:
```typescript
interface CommandsSettings {
  maxCommands?: number;       // optional, maximal number of commands to generate per run: 10 by default
  disableReplayLog?: boolean; // optional, do not show replayPath in the output: false by default
  replayPath?: string;        // optional, hint for replay purposes only: '' by default
                              // should be used in conjonction with {seed, path} of fc.assert
}
```

### Model runner

In order to execute the commands properly a call to either `fc.modelRun` or `fc.asyncModelRun` as to be done within classical runners - *ie. `fc.assert` or `fc.check`*.

### Simplified structure

```typescript
type Model = { /* stuff */ };
type Real  = { /* stuff */ };

class CommandA extends Command { /* stuff */ };
class CommandB extends Command { /* stuff */ };
// other commands

const CommandsArbitrary = fc.commands([
  fc.constant(new CommandA()),        // no custom parameters
  fc.nat().map(s => new CommandB(s)), // with custom parameter
  // other commands
]);

fc.assert(
  fc.property(
    CommandsArbitrary,
    cmds => {
      const s = () => ({ // initial state builder
          model: /* new model */,
          real:  /* new system instance */
      });
      fc.modelRun(s, cmds);
    }
  )
);
```
