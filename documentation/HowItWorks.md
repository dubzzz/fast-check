# [:house:](../README.md) How it works?

Let's take a deep dive into how property based testing frameworks work behind the scene.
Understanding how to implement a simple one should give you a better knowledge of fast-check and its internals.

In this document we will describe how to build a property based testing framework (with limited functionalities) from scratch. Our home-made property based testing framework will be called `miniFc` and will rely on `pure-rand` to generate random values. It should help into understanding the big picture.

Once fully introduced, the document will cover the limitations it has and how fast-check dealt with them.

## Generators

In property based testing everything starts with generators. Generators take a random number generator and build anything out of it.

You can see generators as follow:

```ts
type Generator<T> = {
    generate(mrng: Random): T;
}
```

In the signature above `mrng` is a mutable random generator. It is a simple wrapper around `pure-rand` that provides a usable random instance. The class `Random` can be implemented as follow:

```js
class Random {
    constructor(rng) {
        this.rng = rng;
    }
    next(min, max) {
        const g = prand.uniformIntDistribution(min, max, this.rng);
        this.rng = g[1];
        return g[0];
    }
}

// Can be used as follow:
// > const prand = require('pure-rand');
// > const seed = 0;
// > const mrng = new Random(prand.xoroshiro128plus(seed));
// > mrng.next(0, 50); // generate a random value between 0 (incl.) and 50 (incl.)
// >                   // using a uniform distribution, all values have the same probability
```

For the moment, let's focus on generators. We will discuss later why pure random generators can be useful when doing property based testing.

Let's build our first generator: the one responsible to build random integers.

```js
// const miniFc = {}

miniFc.integer = (min, max) => {
    return {
        generate(mrng) {
            return mrng.next(min, max);
        }
    };
}
// It can be used as follow:
// > miniFc.integer(0, 50).generate(mrng)
```

Our random integer `Generator` is simply returning the value forged by the passed random number generator.

But we want to go further as generators should be able to generate not only integers, they are supposed to generate barely any kind of values. In fast-check, for instance, you can generate numbers, strings, arrays but also objects, functions, recursive structures and also infinite streams of any kind of stuff. In order to produce so many different kind of values without copying the same code again and again, they rely on taking root structures and deriving them into more complex ones as described below:

![From integers to anything](./images/generators.png)

Let's first consider `boolean` and `character`.
In the diagram above they are constructed out of `integer` generator.
In order to do so, we need to introduce an extra function: `map`.
It will take an existing generator and a mapping function and create another generator out of it:

```ts
declare function map<T, U>(g: Generator<T>, mapper: (v: T) => U): Generator<U>;
```

It can be implemented as follow:

```js
function map(g, mapper) {
    return {
        generate(mrng) {
            const value = g.generate(mrng);
            return mapper(value);
        }
    };
}
```

Now that we have `map` we can implement some of our missing generators:

```js
miniFc.boolean = () => map(
    miniFc.integer(0, 1),
    Boolean
)

miniFc.character = () => map(
    miniFc.integer(0, 25),
    n => String.fromCharCode(97 + n)
)
```

In order to build others, we first need to implement a generator for tuples and a generator for arrays:

```js
miniFc.tuple = (...itemGenerators) => {
    return {
        generate(mrng) {
            return itemGenerators.map(g => g.generate(mrng));
        }
    };
}
// It can be used as follow:
// > miniFc.tuple(miniFc.integer(0, 50), miniFc.boolean()).generate(mrng)

miniFc.array = (itemGenerator) => {
    return {
        generate(mrng) {
            const size = mrng.next(0, 10);
            const content = [];
            for (let index = 0 ; index !== size ; ++index) {
                content.push(itemGenerator.generate(mrng));
            }
            return content;
        }
    };
}
// It can be used as follow:
// > miniFc.array(miniFc.character()).generate(mrng)
```

Now we can build our last generators:

```js
miniFc.string = () => map(
    miniFc.array(miniFc.character()),
    characters => characters.join('')
)

miniFc.dictionary = (valueGenerator) => map(
    miniFc.array(
        miniFc.tuple(
            miniFc.string(),
            valueGenerator
        )
    ),
    Object.fromEntries
)
```

## Runner

It is pretty cool to have generators to generate anything but we need to use them. In order to use them in our small framework, we will define what fast-check calls runners.

In fast-check there is one main runner called `fc.assert`.

But first let define what is a property. We will define it as a super generator for simplicity:

```ts
type Property<T> = {
    generate(mrng: Random): T;
    run(valueUnderTest: T): boolean;
}
```

Properties will be created using the following helper:

```js
miniFc.property = (generator, predicate) => {
    return {
        generate(mrng) {
            return generator.generate(mrng);
        },
        run(valueUnderTest) {
            return predicate(valueUnderTest);
        }
    }
}
```

Now, let's consider a simple example to understand how we want to use our minimal version of fast-check. The code under test will be an implementation of `isSubstring` with obviously a bug into it in order to check that our framework can find it. As a user we would like to be able to write:

```js
const isSubstring = (pattern, text) => {
    return text.indexOf(pattern) > 0;
}

miniFc.assert(
    miniFc.property(
        miniFc.tuple(miniFc.string(), miniFc.string(), miniFc.string()),
        ([a, b, c]) => isSubstring(b, a + b + c)
    )
)
```

In terms of typings we have the following signature to fulfill:

```ts
declare function assert<T>(property: Property<T>): void;
```

By default, in most of the frameworks, runners run the property a hundred times and stop if everything is working fine after those hundred runs.

A basic implementation for the runner can be written as follow:

```js
miniFc.assert = property => {
    for (let runId = 0 ; runId !== 100 ; ++runId) {
        const seed = runId;
        const mrng = new Random(prand.xoroshiro128plus(seed));
        const valueUnderTest = property.generate(mrng);
        if (!property.run(valueUnderTest)) {
            throw new Error(`Property failed after ${runId + 1} runs with value ${JSON.stringify(valueUnderTest)}`);
        }
    }
}
```

Additionally in property based testing, seed is supposed not to be fixed except if specified on call-site. Implementation above can be updated as follow:

```js
miniFc.assert = (property, { seed = Date.now() } = {}) => {
    let rng = prand.xoroshiro128plus(seed);
    for (let runId = 0 ; runId !== 100 ; ++runId) {
        const valueUnderTest = property.generate(new Random(rng));
        if (!property.run(valueUnderTest)) {
            throw new Error(`Property failed after ${runId + 1} runs with value ${JSON.stringify(valueUnderTest)} (seed: ${seed})`);
        }
        rng = rng.jump();
    }
}
```

In previous section, we did not cover the reason why we opted for pure random generators. In property based we want properties to be reproducible no matter the seed, no matter the hardware and no matter the time... But we also want to have independent runs for each iteration in the loop.

For instance, in the implementation defined above, we call generate with the following instances of `Random`:
- `runId = 0` - Call with `new Random(prand.xoroshiro128plus(seed))`
- `runId = 1` - Call with `new Random(prand.xoroshiro128plus(seed)).jump()`
- `runId = 2` - Call with `new Random(prand.xoroshiro128plus(seed)).jump().jump()`
- ...

In few words: `jump` offsets a random number generator, in the context of `xoroshiro128plus` calling `jump` is equivalent to 2^64 calls to `next`. In the case of `pure-rand` neither `jump` nor `next` alter the original instance, they both create a new instance of the generator while keeping the original one unchanged.

No matter how many times our property will call the passed mutable random generator, we will always ignore it to build the generator required for the next iteration. While it might appear strange at first glance, this feature is important as we don't really know what will happen to this instance of our random generator. Among the possible scenarios:

- relying on the offset applied by the property to the passed instance of `Random` is problematic as it makes replays difficult to implement except if we re-generate all the values one-by-one whenever replaying stuff
- instance of `Random` might be kept and re-used later by the property and its `Generator` (we will see that it might be the case in some implementations of shrink), thus calls to generate in subsequent iterations might alter it

We can now use our small framework on the property we discussed earlier in this section. As we were expecting, it finds an issue and reports it. When running it locally you should have an output similar to:

```
Property failed after 11 runs with value ["","w","vmethwd"] (seed: 42)
```

## Shrinkers

While our small framework already detects some bugs, it still misses one important feature of property based testing frameworks: shrinking.

Indeed, in such frameworks, whenever a failure occurs it will try to reduce it to something smaller so that the end-user only has to cope with a very simple and small input. I'd say that it helps developers focusing on the real cause without having to manually investigate several potential source of bugs.

For instance: If our `isSubstring` reported an error like: `["", "null$¤¤", "\\undefined.NaN"]`. We may have investigate potentially useless source of bugs.

Before designing complex shrinkers let's see how they integrate themselves in our current design.
First we need to adapt the `Generator` type.

```ts
type Generator<T> = {
    generate(mrng: Random): T;
    shrink(value: T): IterableIterator<T>;
}
```

As you can see in the snippet above, we added a method called `shrink` onto our `Generator` type. This method takes a value - _that have been generated by this `Generator`_ and builds a stream of potential shrinks for this value.

In other words, if I take back our generator of integers, I'd expect the following:
```js
const arb = miniFc.integer(0, 100);
abr.shrink(64) // potential output: 32, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1, 0
```

For integers, the implementation will use a classical technique used in programming: dichotomy. Given the technique we want to use we can adapt the code for `integers` as follow:

```js
miniFc.integer = (min, max) => {
    return {
        generate(mrng) {
            return mrng.next(min, max);
        },
        *shrink(value) {
            while (value !== min) {
                value = min + Math.floor((value - min) / 2);
                yield value;
            }
        }
    }
}
// You can check the output by calling:
// > [...miniFc.integer(0, 100).shrink(64)]
// > [...miniFc.integer(0, 100).shrink(48)]
```

Let's now consider our next root generators: the one for tuples and the one for arrays.

As tuples is simpler let's consider it first. As described in the diagram below a possible way to implement shrink on tuples is to shrink on the first item only, then on the second one only and so on and so forth.

![Shrinking a tuple with an example](./images/shrinker-tuple.png)

While it does not cover all the possible smaller combinations it should be good enough while keeping a great convergence speed. It can be implemented as follow:

```js
miniFc.tuple = (...itemGenerators) => {
    return {
        generate(mrng) {
            return itemGenerators.map(g => g.generate(mrng));
        },
        *shrink(value) {
            for (let index = 0 ; index !== itemGenerators.length ; ++index) {
                const currentGenerator = itemGenerators[index];
                const currentValue = value[index];
                for (const shrunkValue of currentGenerator.shrink(currentValue)) {
                    yield [...value.slice(0, index), shrunkValue, ...value.slice(index + 1)];
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
// You can check the output by calling:
// > [...miniFc.tuple(miniFc.integer(0, 100), miniFc.integer(0, 100), miniFc.integer(0, 100)).shrink([4, 3, 4])]
```

Concerning arrays, the algorithm needs to shrink on two dimensions:
- the size of the array
- the content of the array

When impacting the size, it should not only cover the cases in which we keep the N first items. It should also consider cases in which last item is required to reproduce the failure while the first ones can be partially removed.

For instance, if we consider an algorithm that fails whenever an array contains twice the same item. If it first failed on `[4, 1, 2, 1, 3]` shrinker will have to be able to remove one item at the beginning, one at the middle and one at the end in order to converge towards the minimal case `[1, 1]`.

Shrinking strategy on arrays is divided into three different steps.

1. As most of the time, smaller arrays are simpler to understand, the first step will focus on reducing the size of the array and preserving only the N last items
2. As for tuples, arrays are made of values and shrinking them might also simplify investigations. The second step shrink the first element and concatenate it to the remaining ones (not impacted).
3. We keep the first item as is and apply recursively 1. and 2. on the tail of the array.

Let's apply this logic onto our example `[4, 1, 2, 1, 3]`:
- `[2, 1, 3]` (due to 1.)
- `[1, 2, 1, 3]` (due to 1.)
- `[2, 1, 2, 1, 3]` (due to 2.)
- `[1, 1, 2, 1, 3]` (due to 2.)
- `[0, 1, 2, 1, 3]` (due to 2.)
- `[4, 1, 3]` = `[4] :: [1, 3]` (due to 3.1.)
- `[4, 2, 1, 3]` = `[4] :: [2, 1, 3]` (due to 3.1.)
- `[4, 0, 2, 1, 3]` = `[4] :: [0, 2, 1, 3]` (due to 3.2.)
- ...

We can adapt our implementation of array to to support shrinking as follow:

```js
miniFc.array = (itemGenerator) => {
    return {
        generate(mrng) {
            const size = mrng.next(0, 10);
            const content = [];
            for (let index = 0 ; index !== size ; ++index) {
                content.push(itemGenerator.generate(mrng));
            }
            return content;
        },
        *shrink(value) {
            // No shrink on empty arrays
            if (value.length === 0) {
                return;
            }
            // Step 1. Shrink on size first by keeping last items
            let removedSize = Math.floor(value.length / 2);
            while (removedSize > 0) {
                yield value.slice(removedSize);
                removedSize = Math.floor(removedSize / 2);
            }
            // Step 2. Shrink the first item alone
            for (const shrunkItemValue of itemGenerator.shrink(value[0])) {
                yield [shrunkItemValue, ...value.slice(1)];
            }
            // Step 3. Keep first item untouched
            for (const shrunkValue of this.shrink(value.slice(1))) {
                yield [value[0], ...shrunkValue];
            }
        }
    }
}
// You can check the output by calling:
// > [...miniFc.array(miniFc.integer(0, 100)).shrink([4, 1, 2, 1, 3])]
```

Now that all our root generators have been covered let's adapt the generators based on them. When defined those derived generators we introduced a `map` function to help us in our task.

Generator for characters has been defined as follow:
```js
miniFc.character = () => map(
    miniFc.integer(0, 25),
    n => String.fromCharCode(97 + n)
)
```

As it generates `string` (of a single character), shrinker will consume `string` and produce smaller `string`. But how can `map` know how to convert the `string` received as input of the shrinker to passe it the shrinker of mapped generator (or `miniFc.integer(0, 25)` in our case)?

Actually if we wanted to define the shrinker function for `miniFc.character` we would have written something like:
```js
const shrinker = (character) => {
    const derivedGenerator = miniFc.integer(0, 25);
    const initialValue = character.codePointAt(0) - 97;
    for (const shrunkValue of derivedGenerator.shrink(initialValue)) {
        yield String.fromCharCode(97 + shrunkValue);
    }
}
```

In other words, it means that mapping a generator to derive it requires the user to declare two helper functions:
- one to map - _eg.: from integer to character in our example_
- another one to unmap - _eg.: from character to integer in our example_

With that in mind, `map` can be changed into:

```js
const map = (g, mapper, unmapper) => {
    return {
        generate(mrng) {
            return mapper(g.generate(mrng));
        },
        *shrink(value) {
            for (const shrunkValue of g.shrink(unmapper(value))) {
                yield mapper(shrunkValue);
            }
        }
    };
};
```

And all our derived generators can be adapted to add support for shrink:

```js
miniFc.boolean = () => map(
    miniFc.integer(0, 1),
    Boolean,
    b => b ? 1 : 0,
)
miniFc.character = () => map(
    miniFc.integer(0, 25),
    n => String.fromCharCode(97 + n),
    c => c.codePointAt(0) - 97,
)
miniFc.string = () => map(
    miniFc.array(miniFc.character()),
    characters => characters.join(''),
    s => s.split('')
)
miniFc.dictionary = (valueGenerator) => map(
    miniFc.array(miniFc.tuple(miniFc.string(), valueGenerator)),
    Object.fromEntries,
    Object.entries,
)

// > [...miniFc.boolean().shrink(true)]
// > [...miniFc.character().shrink("h")]
// > [...miniFc.string().shrink("hello")]
// > [...miniFc.dictionary(miniFc.string()).shrink({"hello": "world"})]
```

## Runner with shrink

At this point, our runner is not using shrinker capabilities we introduced in previous part.

Shrinkers have been introduced in an attempt to find the smallest failing case.
They achieve one main purpose: given one value they compute strictly smaller ones.

From a runner perspective, in order to get the smallest possible failing case we want to shrink as soon as we find an issue.
So we generate values and run the predicate on it and as soon as we find an issue we take this value and shrink it.
Moreover while iterating over those shrunk entries we might find another one that will fail, we shrink it and iterate over it until we cannot find smaller bugs.

The process is summarized into the diagram below:

![Shrinking from a runner point of view](./images/shrink-runner.png)

In terms of code, we can adapt our `miniFc.assert` as follow:

```js
miniFc.property = (generator, predicate) => {
    return {
        generate(mrng) {
            return generator.generate(mrng);
        },
        shrink(value) {
            return generator.shrink(value);
        },
        run(valueUnderTest) {
            return predicate(valueUnderTest);
        }
    }
}

function executeAndShrink(valueUnderTest, property) {
    if (!property.run(valueUnderTest)) {
        for (const shrunkValue of property.shrink(valueUnderTest)) {
            const shrunkResults = executeAndShrink(shrunkValue, property);
            if (shrunkResults.failed) {
                return shrunkResults;
            }
        }
        return { failed: true, value: valueUnderTest };
    }
    return { failed: false };
}

miniFc.assert = (property, { seed = Date.now() } = {}) => {
    let rng = prand.xoroshiro128plus(seed);
    for (let runId = 0 ; runId !== 100 ; ++runId) {
        const valueUnderTest = property.generate(new Random(rng));
        const testResults = executeAndShrink(valueUnderTest, property);
        if (testResults.failed) {
            throw new Error(`Property failed after ${runId + 1} runs with value ${JSON.stringify(testResults.value)} (seed: ${seed})`);
        }
        rng = rng.jump();
    }
}
```

Here we are, our home-made property based framework is now able to generate values, run tests and find failures, and in case of failure to shrink it towards something smaller to help our users.

But unfortunately this design was not solid enough...

## Arbitraries

While our current shape for `Generator` seems to be able to deal with many kind of values it implies two major difficulties:

- the `map` function requires a `mapper` and a `rmapper` otherwise it cannot shrink on generated values
- some arbitraries such as `oneof` are barely impossible to write correctly

Indeed, if you think a little bit about implementing `oneof` with current design while preserving shrinking capabilities you may struggle a bit. `oneof` could be used used as follow by users:

```js
miniFc.oneof(
    miniFc.string(),
    miniFc.boolean(),
) // produces either a string or a boolean
```

First, `oneof` would be at the same level as `integer`, `tuple` and `array` but it would not be enough.

How do you shrink a `oneof`? When receiving the value in `shrink(value)` how do you know which one of the passed arbitraries generated the value? For instance, if I call `shrink` with `"abc"` in the generator defined above how can it know that it should use `miniFc.string().shrink` and not `miniFc.boolean().shrink`.

For that reason, some frameworks do not offer shrinking capabilities on `oneof` or if they do they ask for really complex definitions. So how is fast-check doing?

In the past, fast-check used the `Generator` type described in previous sections but has never published any versions using it (see commit [e679f1e0](https://github.com/dubzzz/fast-check/commit/e679f1e018ac29e5b5731e1c30a32a407be2d0cc)). While the `Generator` type offers a great mental model, limitations on shrinking capabilities makes it difficult to use as soon as you want to provide a tool able to generate and shrink on any kind of data.

So fast-check introduced the notion of `Shrinkable` and `Arbitrary`. An `Arbitrary` is more or less the `Generator` we discussed before except that it generates `Shrinkable`. A `Shrinkable` is holding a value and knows how to shrink it. It answers to the question we asked ourselves before: _How do you know which one of the passed arbitraries generated the value?_.

```ts
type Arbitrary<T> = {
    generate(mrng: Random): Shrinkable<T>;
}
type Shrinkable<T> = {
    value: T;
    shrink(): IterableIterator<Shrinkable<T>>;
}
```

## Bias

Have you ever wonder why some frameworks introduced the idea of `size` in the options of their runners?
For instance **jsverify** defines it, as the:

> maximum size of generated values

Actually finding bugs with equiprobable random and no special tricks is hard in many cases. Let's for instance consider an algorithm taking two values as input - for instance `compare` - and returning `true` if the two values are equal. Let's write a property for it:

> For any a, b integers (integers are just possible values we may encounter)
> compare(a, b) should be equivalent to a === b

With our fresh new framework we could write it that way:

```js
// Buggy implementation for `compare`
const compare = (a, b) => false;

miniFc.assert(
    miniFc.property(
        miniFc.tuple(
            miniFc.integer(-0x80000000, 0x7fffffff),
            miniFc.integer(-0x80000000, 0x7fffffff),
        ),
        ([a, b]) => compare(a, b) === (a === b),
    )
)
```

Unfortunately, our framework might not find any bug - _disclaimer: **fast-check** will find the bug_.

Let's zoom on the arbitrary we just defined:
```js
miniFc.tuple(
    miniFc.integer(-0x80000000, 0x7fffffff),
    miniFc.integer(-0x80000000, 0x7fffffff),
)
```

Given this arbitrary we have 2<sup>32</sup> equiprobable possible choices for `a` and 2<sup>32</sup> for `b`. The probability to generate `[a, b]` such that `a === b` would be 1 over 2<sup>32</sup> which is obviously very close to zero.

With that in mind, we have to come with some tricks to get better bug detection. Let's first see some of the techniques that are used in some existing solutions.

**Limit the size of generated values and let the user tweak it if needed**:

This solution has been selected by **jsverify**. The idea is to say that most of the time bugs will occur with small values so why do we want to care about large ones?

And anyway in case our users want they can but have to do it themselves.

In terms of implementation, when calling generate the framework passes it a fixed value corresponding to the size factor that should be applied. This factor is constant throughout the execution whatever the run.

As a consequence when using **jsverify** with its default configuration of size the following properties will be considered truthy and will not fail:

```js
const jsc = require('jsverify'); // 0.8.4

jsc.assert(
    jsc.forall(
        jsc.integer(),
        n => Math.abs(n) <= 50
    )
)
// As a consequence, the property:
// > all integers are smaller or equal to 50 in absolute value
// is true for the framework. Users have to explicitely ask for large values.
```

But let's say we know about this issue, so we artificially increase the size for some of our tests. Then we fall back into the original issue: we will never detect some easy issues because our values will always by too large. For instance, this property succeeds in **jsverify**:

```js
const jsc = require('jsverify'); // 0.8.4

jsc.assert(
    jsc.forall(
        jsc.integer(-0x80000000, 0x7fffffff),
        n => Math.abs(n) > 50
    )
)
// We generate values from -0x80000000 to 0x7fffffff
// The probability to generate one value such that abs(n) <= 50
// is: 101 / 2**32 which is close to zero

// Same issue if we use size option...
jsc.assert(
    jsc.forall(
        jsc.integer(),
        n => Math.abs(n) > 50
    ),
    { size: 0x7fffffff }
)
```

The last issue with this approach is that you cannot really say that one arbitrary should be large while another should not. The size apply to all the arbitaries.

_This approach has been rejected by fast-check. The motto of the framework is to hide such complexity for most of the users. Users should not have to tell the framework if large values will cause bugs or not. They should only say that large values are considered as valid inputs or not. Then the framework should do its best to find bugs either with large or small values or even combination of both._

**Increasing values across the runs**:

**RapidCheck**, a property based testing framework for C++, adopted another technique that has the benefit to cover both small and large values.

The observation is the following: smallest values have most of the time the benefit of being less costly to manage and as a consequence may find bugs earlier. Indeed sorting and array of 0 items will be quicker than sorting one with a billion of items. But not all algorithms fail with small items so randomly generated values should also cover large ones.

As a consequence the approach is the following: the more we play runs, the more we increase the size of the generated values. During the first runs we try with very small values because they will most of the time execute quickly and may find specific corner cases (think about bugs due to `-1`, `0` or `1`). And at the end we generate values covering the full range of allowed values;

For example, when you ask for arrays - _of size 0 to 10_ - containing only natural numbers - _between 0 to 2147483647_ - here is what you may have with such approach:
- run 1/100: arrays having `0` to `floor(10 / 100) = 0` items of values between `0` and `floor(2147483647 / 100) = 21474836`
- run 2/100: arrays having `0` to `floor(2 * 10 / 100) = 0` items of values between `0` and `floor(2 * 2147483647 / 100)`
- ...
- run 100/100: arrays having `0` to `floor(100 * 10 / 100) = 10` items of values between `0` and `floor(100 * 2147483647 / 100) = 2147483647`

Even if this approach has lots of benefits it still misses one class of bugs.

What if our bug only occurs when we have a small array containing very large values or a large array containing only small values? You can for instance think about a sort that is supposed to be stable. In order to test such sort we will do something like (written in fast-check to keep code in JavaScript):

```js
const fc = require('fast-check');

fc.assert(
    fc.property(
        fc.array(
            fc.record({
                x: fc.integer(),
                y: fc.integer(),
            })
        ),
        points => {
            expect(
                sortWith(
                    sortWith([...points], (a, b) => a.y - b.y),
                    (a,b) => a.x - b.x
                )
            ).toEqual(
                sortWith([...points], (a, b) => {
                    if (a.x === b.x) return a.y - b.y;
                    else return a.x - b.x;
                })
            )
        }
    )
)
// In other words when a sort is stable it means that if two items
// are considered equivalent regarding the comparison operator
// they we stay respectively in the same order.
// In the code above, with stable sort, sorting by y then by x
// is equivalent to sort by x and for equal values of x sort by y.
```

If we apply the suggestion above, during early runs we will generate very small arrays thus the chance to have cases in which `a.x === b.x` will be limited. Then as we reach the end, we will generate larger arrays but with large scopes of values for `x` thus the probabilty to have twice the same value for `x` will be once again low.

_fast-check approach is close to this one but adds an extra trick to it._

**More chance to produce small values during early runs than after**:

The approach implemented in fast-check is pretty close to the one of **RapidCheck**. The only difference is that instead of generating only small values for early runs and only large values for latest ones, it biases early runs so that they will have a higher probability to generate small values.

The choice is to bias the arbitrary 1 time over `freq` - _where `freq` is a value specified into the call to generate (a bit like `size` was passed to generate in **jsverify** instead that this time the value increases over the runs)_.

For `fc.integer`:
- 1 over `freq`: smaller values
- remaining: the full range of values

For `fc.array`:
- 1 over `freq`:
  - 1 over `freq`: small array with smaller values
  - remaining: full range array with smaller values
- remaining: full range array with full range of values

## Cloneable

Theoretically every generator should produce only pure values that should never be modified by the user.

For instance, you should never alter the array produced by the generator of arrays of fast-check otherwise you may face strange behaviour when shrinking. To be honest, fast-check more or less prevents such bugs internally so that most of the time it will not cause any problems with built-in arbitraries. But the less you do that, the more you avoid strange bugs.

But purity comes with one major drawback in that case: How can I do arbitraries that need to know what happens to the generated value in order to shrink properly?

In fast-check there are at least two arbitraries that has those needs:
- `fc.context` - it allows users to log stuff during the execution of the test, in other words the generated value is a context and you alter it during the execution
- `fc.commands` - it allows users to use fast-check for model based testing

Let's focus on the later one. In the context of model based testing, fast-check has to generate large arrays of commands. This task is the responsability of `fc.commands`. As soon as we get our commands, we can play the test: the test will take the commands one by one, ignore some of them because some preconditions have not been fulfilled and may find a bug before reaching the end of the commands. As a consequence if the generated commands where `[a, b, c, d, e]` and the test failed at `d` while it skipped `b` and `c`, shrinking `[a, b, c, d, e]` would make no sense. What we should shrink should be `[a, d]`. And this is why fast-check introduced the notion of cloneable: sometimes we want to alter the generated value.

Any generator can produce cloneable values. A cloneable value is a generated value that has the method `fc.cloneMethod` implemented. Whenever this method is exposed by an instance, fast-check knows that this instance needs a special treatment. Such instance will never be re-used twice, instead each time fast-check needs the _same value_ it will call the `fc.cloneMethod` method of the instance to get a similar instance.
