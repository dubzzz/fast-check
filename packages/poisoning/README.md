## Why?

In JavaScript, "prototype poisoning" is one of the most common source for CVEs or zero days. It allows attackers to change the behaviour of some defaults like `Array.prototype.map`, `Map`, `Set`... so that they behave differently and can be leveraged for evil stuffs. This package can be used in addition to `fast-check` in order to detect poisoning that may occur during your property based tests.

## Easy to use

The package comes with:

- `assertNoPoisoning`: assert that the defaults known when first importing the package in your code have not been changed
- `restoreGlobals`: restore the defaults so that any change that could have been detected by `assertNoPoisoning` will be resolved

## Minimal requirements

- Node â‰¥8.0.0
