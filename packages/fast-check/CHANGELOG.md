# 3.0.0

_Easier and more expressive thanks to the full support of size and a new and extensible API for custom arbitraries_
[[Code](https://github.com/dubzzz/fast-check/tree/v3.0.0)][[Diff](https://github.com/dubzzz/fast-check/compare/v2.25.0...v3.0.0)]

This new major of fast-check is:

- **extensible**: extending the framework with custom arbitraries made easy
- **expressive properties**: write properties corresponding to specs without dealing with internals of the library ([more](https://github.com/dubzzz/fast-check/issues/2648))
- **recursive structures**: better native handling of recursive structures without any tweaks around internals
- **unified signatures**: unify signatures cross-arbitraries ([more](https://github.com/dubzzz/fast-check/pull/992))
